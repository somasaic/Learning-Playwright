Problem Statement - 8

Test Environment Config
In CI/CD pipelines, tests run against different environments. 
Write a JavaScript program using a switch statement that takes an environment name stored in a variable and prints the base URL, API key pattern, and timeout. 
Use const for fixed values and let for the assembled config.

Environments: dev, staging, qa, production/prod. 
Each has different base URL, API key prefix, timeout, and description.

Input:
envName = "staging"

Output:
Environment: STAGING 
Base URL: https://staging-api.testingacademy.com 
API Key: stg_key_xxxx-xxxx 
Timeout: 8000ms 
Description: Staging - Pre-production mirror

💡 Explanation:The switch matches "staging" and sets the corresponding configuration values for the staging environment.
