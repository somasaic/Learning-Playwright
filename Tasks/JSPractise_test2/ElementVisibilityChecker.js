Problem Statement 4 -

Element Visibility Checker
In UI automation (Cypress/Playwright), you often need to validate element states before interacting with them. 
Write a JavaScript program that checks an element's properties (isPresent, isDisplayed, isEnabled) and 
prints the appropriate action a QA engineer should take. 
Use strict equality (===), logical operators (&&, ||), and the ternary operator for severity level.

States: READY (all true), DISABLED (present+displayed but not enabled), HIDDEN (present but not displayed), 
NOT FOUND (not present).
Severity: CRITICAL (not present), WARNING (not displayed or not enabled), OK (all good).

Input:
isPresent = true, isDisplayed = true, isEnabled = false

Output:
Status: DISABLED Severity: WARNING Action: Element is visible but disabled. 
Wait for enable state or check preconditions.

💡 Explanation:Element is present and displayed but not enabled. Severity is WARNING because it's not fully interactable.
